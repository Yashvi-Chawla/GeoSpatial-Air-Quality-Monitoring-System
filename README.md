# GeoSpatial-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System

With increasing air pollution, the quality of air has been excessively degrading since the last few years. Air quality has become a major
concern today due to itâ€™s adverse impacts on human health and to the ecosystem as a whole. Thus, there is a need for efficient air
quality monitoring systems to capture the trends in air quality and help citizens understand the different levels of pollution they are
experiencing in their everyday lives. To address this issue, we proposed and developed a real time full stack IoT based
Geo spatial air quality monitoring system. The project aims at collecting data for longer periods of time at different locations in the
city of Edinburgh and perform analysis on the spatio-temporal variation of the pollutants measured using cloud solutions. Moreover,
the system aims at notifying the users subscribed to our monitoring service the changes in air quality when it exceeds certain limits.
Other than analysis and visualization of collected data, we also discuss the security aspects of the end to end prototype developed.
Based on this, the objectives of our project are:
* Build a firmware for our IoT system.
* Build a simple Android Application that enables sending the measurements collected by the sensors to the cloud.
* Build a cloud based analytics pipeline and a visualization dashboard for spatio temporal data processing and real time visualization of air quality.
* Build a notification system to alert the users about the air quality in their location.
* Use encryption-decryption techniques to ensure secure transfer of data from the embedded device to the cloud
