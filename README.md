# GeoSpatial-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System

With increasing air pollution, the quality of air has been excessively degrading since the last few years. Air quality has become a major
concern today due to itâ€™s adverse impacts on human health and to the ecosystem as a whole. Thus, there is a need for efficient air
quality monitoring systems to capture the trends in air quality and help citizens understand the different levels of pollution they are
experiencing in their everyday lives. To address this issue, we proposed and developed a full stack IoT based Geo-Spatial air quality monitoring
system. Different sensors are used to collect the pollutants in the air and assess the air quality. A cloud based analytics pipeline is created
for analysing and visualizing the collected pollutant concentrations. An air quality index (AQI) is computed from these pollutant concentrations
and is used to notify the users about the quality of air in their location.The system is capable to handle trends in air quality in real time.
